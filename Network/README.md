### Network Searches

So people are increasingly doing searches on network data for things like T1043, "Commonly Used Ports." Like searches for LOLBins (living off the land techniques) these need to be very refined searches in order to have a useful signal to noise ratio. Here is a first pass at a set of searches for the Lateral Movement/Remote Services https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/ and Command and Control / Commonly Used Ports (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1043/) techniques. Some of these include differential searches for the activity with a choice of an Internet source or destination. The reason for this is that there is not a universal set of network searches that describes normal vs. suspicious network behavior because different organizations have very different workflows and security policies. While all of these network behaviors are used by threat activity, you may need to whitelist any servers or subnets that use these ports and protocols for normal workflows.
