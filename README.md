### Hunts, searches and alerts for for intrusion detection, security analytics and threat hunting using F/OSS (free and open source) tools

A set of all known log and / or event data searches for threat hunting and  detection.  They enumerate sets of searches used across many different data pipelines. Implementation details are for ELK.

### Contents

Authentication - searches for authentication data sets hunting for brute force, credential compromise, credentialed persistence and session fixation / hijacking

Cloud - searches for cloud and virtualization specific threats using API and cloud centric data

Correlation - search techniques that combine different events in order to make complex and sophisticated detections

Cross-platform - general purpose searches for threat hunting on hosts. These behavioral detection techniques are relevant to Linux, MacOS and Windows hosts

Database - searches for database monitoring and compromise

Exfiltration - a list of known data exfiltration techniques and related searches

Linux - searches for threat hunting on Linux hosts

Mac -  searches for threat hunting on Linux hosts

Machine Learning - Anomaly detection searches using the significant terms aggregation; good for finding things that evade conventional rules.

Network - searches for threat hunting using network data like IDS, proxy and flow events

Web  - searches for detecting attacks on web servicers using web server logs

Windows -  searches for threat hunting on Windows hosts
